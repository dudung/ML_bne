# ML_bne
Using machine learning methods to predict Brazil Nut Effect output.

## Simulation
The data input of the model are obtained from simulation of Brazil Nut Effect simulation based on molecular dynamic method.<br>
The demo can be accessed here: https://raw.githack.com/miqbalrp/ML_bne/main/simulation/src/bne_single.html <br>

## Notebook
For development stages, use Jupyter Notebook to build models and any other necessary analysis.<br>
Use this format for naming the notebook file: `username_description.ipynb`, <br>
ex: <br>
`miqbalrp_support-vector-machine.ipynb`.<br>
`azzahrandhr_multilayer-perceptron.ipynb`.<br>

Please update the brief description of the notebook below if there are any new notebook.<br>
* `data_preparation.ipynb` -> Preprocessing raw data into ready-to-use data.
* `data_visualization.ipynb` -> Visualize data with charts to get early insight of the data
